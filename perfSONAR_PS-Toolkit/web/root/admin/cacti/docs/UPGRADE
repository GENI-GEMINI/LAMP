    1. Backup the old Cacti database.

 shell> mysqldump -l --add-drop-table cacti > mysql.cacti

       Note: You will probably have to specify the -u and -p flags for the
       MySQL username and password. This user must have permission to read
       from Cacti's database or you will end up with an empty backup.

    2. Backup the old Cacti directory.

 shell> mv cacti cacti_old

    3. Extract the distribution tarball.

 shell> tar xzvf cacti-version.tar.gz

    4. Rename the new Cacti directory to match the old one.

 shell> mv cacti-version cacti

    5. Edit include/config.php and specify the MySQL user, password and
       database for your Cacti configuration.

 $database_type = "mysql";
 $database_default = "cacti";
 $database_hostname = "localhost";
 $database_username = "cactiuser";
 $database_password = "cacti";

    6. Copy the *.rrd files from the old Cacti directory.

 shell> cp cacti_old/rra/* cacti/rra/

    7. Copy any relevant custom scripts from the old Cacti directory. Some
       script are updated between versions. Therefore, make sure you only
       over write if the scripts either don't exist or are newer than the
       distribution's.

 shell> cp -u cacti_old/scripts/* cacti/scripts/

    8. Copy any relevant custom resource XML files from the old Cacti
       directory. Some resource XML files are updated between versions.
       Therefore, make sure you only over write if the XML files either don't
       exist or are newer than the distribution's.

 shell> cp -u -R cacti_old/resource/* cacti/resource/

    9. Set the appropriate permissions on Cacti's directories for graph/log
       generation. You should execute these commands from inside Cacti's
       directory to change the permissions.

 shell> chown -R cactiuser rra/ log/

       (Enter a valid username for cactiuser, this user will also be used in
       the next step for data gathering.)

   10. Point your web browser to:

         http://your-server/cacti/

       Follow the on-screen instructions so your database can be updated to
       the new version.
